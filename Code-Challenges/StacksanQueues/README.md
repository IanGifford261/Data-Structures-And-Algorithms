## Challenge
Implement a Stacks Data Structure and a Queues Data Structure.

- [X] Built out Node.cs
- [x] Built out Stack.cs with methods needed
- [x] Wrote several tests for passing conditions

## Example
![Proof of Life]()

### Time and Efficiency Approach

-Space and Time: 
- Create Stack 
Time: O(1) - Do not run through anything
Space: O(1) - Nothing new is created

- Add
Time: O(1) - Adding value onto the top
Space: O(1) - Nothing new is created

- Pop
Time: O(1) - Adding value onto the top
Space: O(1) - Nothing new is created

- Peek
Time: O(1) - Do not run through anything
Space: O(1) - Nothing new is created

- Create Queueue
Time: O(1) - Do not run through anything
Space: O(1) - Nothing new is created

- Enqueue
Time: O(1) - Do not run through anything, only add new value to the front
Space: O(1) - Nothing new is created

- Dequeue
Time: O(1) - Do not run through anything
Space: O(1) - Nothing new is created
